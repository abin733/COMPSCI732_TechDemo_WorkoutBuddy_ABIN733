Author: Syahiiid Rasidi (abin733)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Workout Buddy MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) App! This application is designed to help users manage their workout routines and track their progress effectively. The app includes features such as creating new workouts, viewing existing workouts and deleting exisiting workouts.

To deploy the Workout Buddy MERN App using GitHub Desktop instead of the CLI, you can follow these steps:

### Option A: Installation and Setup (using Github Desktop)

5. **Install Backend Dependencies:**
   Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the backend directory. You can do this by right-clicking inside the directory and selecting "Open in Terminal". Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

6. **Start the Backend Server:**
   After the dependencies are installed, run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Access Backend API:**
   Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/api/workouts](http://localhost:3000/api/workouts) to emulate the GET query.

8. **Open Another Terminal for Frontend:**
    Within Code, navigate to the frontend directory and open a terminal by right-clicking it.

9. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
   Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the frontend directory. You can do this by right-clicking inside the directory and selecting "Open in Terminal". Then run:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

10. **Start the Frontend Client:**
    After the dependencies are installed, start the frontend client with:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

By following these steps, you'll be able to set up and run the Workout Buddy MERN App using GitHub Desktop instead of the command line interface.

## Option B: Installation and Setup (using Git Terminal). Please skip if you have done cloning using GitHub Desktop.

To get started with the Workout Buddy MERN App, follow these steps by running this command from a terminal on your machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/abin733/COMPSCI732_TechDemo_WorkoutBuddy_ABIN733
```

2. IMPORTANT! Checkout to 'local' branch for localhost deployment!
```
git checkout local
```

3. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd COMPSCI732_TechDemo_WorkoutBuddy_ABIN733
```

4. Navigate to the backend directory:
```
cd backend
```

5. Install dependencies using npm: (prerequisite: NodeJS and MongoDB Community version are installed on the same machine)
```
npm install
```

6. Start the backend server:
```
npm run dev
```

7. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000/api/workouts](http://localhost:3000/api/workouts) for emulating the GET query.


8. Open another terminal from project directory (COMPSCI732_TechDemo_WorkoutBuddy_ABIN733) and navigate to the frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
```

9. Install frontend ependencies using npm:

```
npm install
```

10. Start the frontend client:

```
npm run dev
```

## Features

## Deployment

The Workout Buddy MERN App is deployed on Vercel. The frontend is accessible at [https://frontend-seven-sigma-33.vercel.app/](https://frontend-seven-sigma-33.vercel.app/), and the backend API is accessible at [https://backend-eta-smoky.vercel.app/api/workouts](https://backend-eta-smoky.vercel.app/api/workouts).

### Vercel Deployment

To deploy the backend and frontend of a GitHub project separately on Vercel using their website, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Create a Vercel Account:**
   If you haven't already, sign up for an account on Vercel.

2. **Connect Your GitHub Repository:**
   Once logged in, navigate to your Vercel dashboard and click on the "Import Project" button. Then select the GitHub repository you want to deploy.

3. **Configure the Project:**
   After importing your repository, Vercel will analyze it and provide configuration options. Here, you can specify settings such as the branch to deploy, build settings, environment variables, etc.

4. **Deploy the Backend:**
   In the project settings or deployment configurations, specify the directory containing your backend code. This might be a subdirectory within your repository where your backend code resides.

5. **Deploy the Frontend:**
   Similarly, configure another deployment for your frontend code. Specify the directory containing your frontend code (e.g., the `build` folder for React applications).

6. **Environment Variables:**
   Set any required environment variables for both the backend and frontend deployments if needed.
   In my case, my MONGO_URI for Backend deployment.

7. **Review and Deploy:**
   Once configurations are set, review your settings and click the "Deploy" button for each deployment.

8. **Wait for Deployment:**
   Vercel will start building and deploying your projects separately. You can monitor the progress in the Vercel dashboard.

9. **Test Your Deployments:**
   Once deployed, test both your backend and frontend deployments to ensure everything is working as expected.

By following these steps, you'll be able to deploy the backend and frontend of your GitHub project separately on Vercel without using the CLI, directly through their website.
